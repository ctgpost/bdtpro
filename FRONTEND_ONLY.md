## 📋 What's Removed

All backend-related components have been removed:

- **Server directory** - Contains Express.js backend
- **API directory** - Contains serverless functions
- **Database files** - Schema definitions and setup scripts
- **Backend dependencies** - Removed from package.json
- **Server configuration** - vite.config.server.ts
- **Database setup** - setup-db.sql

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Authentication
Instead of connecting to a real backend, authentication is simulated:
- Credentials are validated against predefined demo users
- User data is stored in localStorage
- Session management is handled client-side

### Data Management
All data is simulated in-memory:
- Countries, tickets, bookings stored in JavaScript objects
- CRUD operations update these in-memory collections
- Data persists during the session but not between sessions

### API Calls
API calls are simulated with:
- Mock data responses
- Artificial network delays
- Promise-based async operations

## 🚀 Development

### Running Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

### Previewing Production Build
```bash
npm run preview
```

## 🌐 Deployment

This frontend-only version can be deployed to any static hosting service:
- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages
- Firebase Hosting
- Any CDN or static file server

### Deployment Steps
1. Run `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder
3. Configure routing to serve `index.html` for all routes (SPA routing)

## ⚠️ Limitations

This frontend-only version has some limitations compared to the full application:

1. **No Data Persistence** - Data doesn't persist between sessions
2. **No Real Authentication** - Authentication is simulated
3. **No Multi-user Support** - All users see the same data
4. **No Real-time Updates** - No WebSocket or real-time features
5. **No Server-side Processing** - All logic runs in the browser

## 🔄 Converting Back to Full Application

To convert back to the full application with backend services:

1. Restore the `server` and `api` directories
2. Add back backend dependencies to package.json
3. Restore database configuration files
4. Update authentication to use real API calls
5. Configure backend services (PostgreSQL, etc.)
